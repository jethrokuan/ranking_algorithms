	abstract = {We present a physically inspired model and an efficient algorithm to infer hierarchical rankings of nodes in directed networks. It assigns real-valued ranks to nodes rather than simply ordinal ranks, and it formalizes the assumption that interactions are more likely to occur between individuals with similar ranks. It provides a natural statistical significance test for the inferred hierarchy, and it can be used to perform inference tasks such as predicting the existence or direction of edges. The ranking is obtained by solving a linear system of equations, which is sparse if the network is; thus, the resulting algorithm is extremely efficient and scalable. We illustrate these findings by analyzing real and synthetic data, including data sets from animal behavior, faculty hiring, social support networks, and sports tournaments. We show that our method often outperforms a variety of others, in both speed and accuracy, in recovering the underlying ranks and predicting edge directions.},

                  Comparisons},

  abstract =     {This paper explores the preference-based top-$K$
                  rank aggregation problem. Suppose that a collection
                  of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one
                  wishes to recover a consistent ordering that
                  emphasizes the top-$K$ ranked items, based on
                  partially revealed preferences. We focus on the
                  Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set
                  of latent preference scores underlying all items,
                  where the odds of paired comparisons depend only on
                  the relative scores of the items involved. We
                  characterize the minimax limits on identifiability
                  of top-$K$ ranked items, in the presence of random
                  and non-adaptive sampling. Our results highlight a
                  separation measure that quantifies the gap of
                  preference scores between the $K^{\text{th}}$ and
                  $(K+1)^{\text{th}}$ ranked items. The minimum sample
                  complexity required for reliable top-$K$ ranking
                  scales inversely with the separation measure
                  irrespective of other preference distribution
                  metrics. To approach this minimax limit, we propose
                  a nearly linear-time ranking scheme, called
                  \emph{Spectral MLE}, that returns the indices of the
                  top-$K$ items in accordance to a careful score
                  estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with an
                  initial score estimate with minimal squared loss
                  (obtained via a spectral method), and then
                  successively refines each component with the
                  assistance of coordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly,
                  Spectral MLE allows perfect top-$K$ item
                  identification under minimal sample complexity. The
                  practical applicability of Spectral MLE is further
                  corroborated by numerical experiments.},
